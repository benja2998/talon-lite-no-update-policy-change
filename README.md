Lighter variant of Talon compatible with in-use systems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Talon Lite **is** compatible with Windows 10/11 Home/Professional/Enterprise/Education/LTSC unlike [Talon](https://github.com/ravendevteam/talon), however it does not debloat as much compared to the regular version as a result.
